Topology Optimization
Complete e-axle housing geometry developed including motor interface, differential casing, lubrication channels, and mounting bosses.
Structural FEA for torque reaction loads, bending stiffness, bearing seat deformation, and load-path evaluation.
Topology optimization reduced ~18–25% non-load-bearing mass while maintaining strength and fatigue safety factors.
Thermal analysis verified operating temperature limits under continuous and peak loads.
NVH evaluation ensured resonance modes outside motor torque harmonics.
Optimized packaging for compact EV rear subframe integration ensuring manufacturability and assembly accessibility.
Modeling and Analysis of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Blade
Apr – Jul 2024
Designed and analyzed a Savonius-type Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) blade using CATIA V5, SolidWorks, QBlade, and ANSYS. Evaluated aerodynamic forces, structural deformation, and stress distribution under varying wind conditions. Simulations confirmed that aluminium alloy blades maintain low deformation and operate within safe stress limits.
